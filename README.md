Step 1 - Data Cleaning - 
  The data had to be cleaned before it could be used for analysis. All the personal information of the people have been hidden in order to maintain their privacy and made the data more public view friendly.  
  Q1- Cleaned the Current role section as the data was dirty and a lot of options (in other roles)
  Q3- Calculated the average salary in USD from the rage of salary provided by the people 
  Q4- People mentioned the names of programming languages they use most of them was others- SQL 
  Q11- This column contained info regrading what country they belong from- Apart from USA,Canada,UK and India all other countries fall under [Others] field.  

Step 2 - Data Visulaization - 
  Created a total of 8 visuals to understand the data more clearly and chose a theme to make the representation more pleasing and clear.
  Cards Visual - On the top right below the heading we can see 2 values 
    1- Total count of people who have took the surve is 630.
    2- Average age of the people who have took the survey is around 30.
  Pie graph - The graph represents the distribution of level of difficulty faced by people. We can see that it was very easy/easy for around half of the people who took the survey.
  Tree Map - Treemap consists of the distribution of distinct count of people who took the survey from each country. Apart from USA,Canada,UK and India all other countries fall under [Others] field.  
  Stacked Bar Chart- This chart gives us the pictorial representataion of the distribution of average salary on the different roles opleple are in. For Example the average Data Science person around twice the average Database Developer does.
  Stacked Column Chart- Stacked Column chart is the visual i have chosen to present the relation between the number of people and their favrouite programming language. This could be well related with the fact wha their job requires them to use. For Example Datascientist will use a lot of python and hence they prefer python language and hence it is widely used all over the IT industry.
  Gauge - I have use gauge to make the visulaization more dynamic (Cards/KPI,s) could also have been used to present the data. 
   1-Work/Life Balance-It tells us that only 5.5 out of 10 people or (57%) people are okay with the current work/life balance the are expreincing right now.
   2-Current Salary- It tells us that only 4 out of 10 or 42% percent of people are are satistfied with the current salary package.
